# üêç 12 Beginner Python Projects (freeCodeCamp)

This repository contains my solutions to the **12 Beginner Python Projects** tutorial by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  
It‚Äôs part of my journey to strengthen my Python skills by building small, practical projects.

## üìö About the Projects
These projects cover fundamental Python concepts such as:
- Variables & data types
